Basic example of using `vike-solid`.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:magne4000/vike-solid
cd vike-solid/examples/basic/
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

> **NOTE:** for now `pnpm` is required because of the `workspace:` specifier in
> `package.json`. With this, the example makes use of the local `vike-solid`
> implementation instead of the downloading it from npm.
